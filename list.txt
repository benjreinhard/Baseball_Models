1. Swing decision model
  -modeled off the U AZ process chart
  -swing decision score a la seager?

2. Contact Rate Score? hit tool score?

3. xWhiff

4. Mix+

5. Match+

6. Biomechanics Models
  -Mechanics score: with velocity
  -Velocity with mechanics
    -some sort of maximize velocity while minimize stress. 

7. Stuff+ Model
  -Calculate Run Values for D1/D2/D3/JUCO/Overall College
  -Also do a model for MLB -- probably will need to have fewer features
  -Change movement (VB/HB) into acceleration in general format
  -Find a way to control for location so it doesn't boost stuff w/consistent location
  -Total incorporation into app
    -Can select any of the models to see how you compare across levels
  -Separate import and manual entry for stuff models to clean up app page

8. Pitching+ Model
  -Take new run values
  -Create model to run for all the various levels (D1/2/3/Juco/all college/MLB)
    -Model is essentially the stuff+ model but with the addition of location as features
  -Make sure acceleration for movement -- this should be done with Stuff+ 
    -Total incorporation into app -- would only be for import page
  -same thing with various levels and being able to select for comparison 

9. Location+ Model
  -Again, use new run values for all levels (D1/2/3/Juco/MLB)
  -2 separate models: 1 that controls for stuff+ and another that is purely based on location
    -does it make sense to split since would be import only?
  -Total incorporation into app, same deal with selection between various models for comparison across levels
  -Maybe other command projects too; see this article: https://blogs.fangraphs.com/revisiting-the-kirby-index/


10. xGB% Model
  -Again, recalculated run values and for all levels (D1/2/3/JUCO/MLB)
  -2 separate models: on import that incorporates location and solely based on pitch characteristics
  -Total incorporation between app and selection between levels
