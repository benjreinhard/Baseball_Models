1. Take new run values
2. Create model to run for all the various levels (D1/2/3/Juco/all college/MLB)
  -Model is essentially the stuff+ model but with the addition of location as features
3. Make sure acceleration for movement -- this should be done with Stuff+ 
4. Total incorporation into app -- would only be for import page
  -same thing with various levels and being able to select for comparison
