1. Again, use new run values for all levels (D1/2/3/Juco/MLB)
2. 2 separate models: 1 that controls for stuff+ and another that is purely based on location
  -does it make sense to split since would be import only?
3. Total incorporation into app, same deal with selection between various models for comparison across levels
4. Maybe other command projects too; see this article: https://blogs.fangraphs.com/revisiting-the-kirby-index/
