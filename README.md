# This repo has a bunch of models that can be used to evaluate baseball players. Current models: 
  - Stuff+, xWhiff%, xGB%, and a script that calculates a cut-off for 'hard-hit' batted ball. See note below -- all are wip
  - While the main focus is pitching, I tend to add some hitting models as well. 


# Models I hope to add
  - Swing Decision Model
    - The SEAGER stat is really intriuging to me, would love to do something like that for college baseball.
  - Hit Tool Model
    - Could be used as some sort of draft model.
  - Mix+, Match+, Pitching+, Location+
     - All of the models are WIP. I change my mind a lot on how exactly they should work & what i want to do. 
     - Location+ model could also be expanded into others, see this article:

  - Some biomechanics models
      - For both hitting and pitching.
      - These are really initial stage of ideas.
      - For pitching, I think something on maximizing velocity while minimizing stress (elbow valgus?) would be really cool
